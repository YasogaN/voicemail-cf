## Architecture

The service is built using modern web technologies:

- **Runtime**: Cloudflare Workers
- **Framework**: Hono with Chanfana for OpenAPI support
- **Storage**: Cloudflare R2 for recording files and metadata
- **Validation**: Zod for runtime type checking
- **Voice Processing**: Provider-specific SDKs (Twilio)
- **Testing**: Vitest with comprehensive test coverage

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Cloudflare Workers account](https://workers.dev) (free tier sufficient)
- [Node.js 16+](https://nodejs.org/) (specified in package.json engines)
- [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YasogaN/voicemail-cf.git
   cd voicemail-cf
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Authenticate with Cloudflare**

   ```bash
   wrangler login
   ```

4. **Setup Providers**

   Choose and configure your voice service provider:

   <details>
   <summary><strong>Twilio</strong></summary>

   #### Step 1: Create Twilio API Key

   Create a Twilio API key with restricted scopes for security:

   1. Log in to your [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com/)
   2. Navigate to [API keys & tokens](https://console.twilio.com/us1/account/keys-credentials/api-keys)
   3. Click **Create API key**
   4. Set the key type to **Restricted**
   5. Configure the following scopes:
      - `voice.calls:read`
      - `voice.recordings:read`
      - `voice.recordings:delete`
   6. Save the API Key SID and Secret (you won't be able to see the secret again)

   #### Step 2: Configure Twilio Phone Number

   1. Purchase a phone number in your [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/phone-numbers/manage/incoming)
   2. Configure the webhook URL for your phone number:
      - Voice webhook: `https://your-worker.workers.dev/incoming`
      - HTTP method: `GET`

   #### Step 3: Set Twilio Environment Variables

   Configure the following Twilio-specific environment variables:

   ```bash
   # Twilio API credentials
   wrangler secret put twilio_api_key    # Your Twilio API Key SID
   wrangler secret put twilio_api_secret # Your Twilio API Key Secret
   ```

   </details>

5. **Configure General Environment Variables**

   Set the following general environment variables that apply to all providers:

   ```bash
   # Provider configuration
   wrangler secret put provider          # Your chosen provider (e.g., twilio)
   wrangler secret put endpoint          # Your deployed worker URL

   # Phone numbers (comma-separated for multiple numbers)
   wrangler secret put numbers           # +1234567890,+0987654321

   # Recording configuration
   wrangler secret put recording_type    # url or text
   wrangler secret put recording_url     # URL to audio file (if type=url)
   wrangler secret put recording_text    # Text to speak (if type=text)
   wrangler secret put recording_max_length  # Maximum recording duration in seconds
   ```

6. **Create Cloudflare R2 bucket**

   Create an R2 bucket to store voicemail recordings:

   ```bash
   # Create the R2 bucket (replace 'recordings' with your preferred name)
   wrangler r2 bucket create recordings
   ```

   Alternatively, you can create the bucket through the Cloudflare dashboard:

   - Go to [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
   - Navigate to R2 Object Storage
   - Click "Create bucket"
   - Enter a unique bucket name (e.g., `recordings`)
   - Choose your preferred location
   - Click "Create bucket"

   **Note**: Make sure to update your `wrangler.jsonc` file to reference the bucket name you created.

7. **Deploy to Cloudflare Workers**
   ```bash
   wrangler deploy
   ```

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive testing with Vitest:

### Test Structure

- **Unit Tests**: Individual endpoint and provider logic testing
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow testing (placeholder directory ready)
- **Configuration Tests**: Environment variable validation testing
- **Mock Support**: R2 bucket mocking with `cloudflare-test-utils`

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
yarn test

# Run tests with coverage report
yarn run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode during development
yarn run test:watch
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite covers:

- All API endpoints (`/health`, `/incoming`, `/record`, `/hangup`, `/store`)
- Provider implementations (Twilio)
- Configuration validation and parsing
- Error handling scenarios
- TwiML response generation

### Development

1. **Start local development server**

   ```bash
   yarn run dev
   ```

   This starts the Wrangler development server with hot reloading.

2. **Access the API documentation**
   Open `http://localhost:8787/` to view the interactive OpenAPI documentation powered by Chanfana.

3. **Test endpoints**
   The Swagger interface allows you to test all endpoints directly from the browser, or use tools like curl/Postman.

4. **Run tests during development**

   ```bash
   yarn run test:watch
   ```

5. **Generate TypeScript types**
   ```bash
   yarn run cf-typegen
   ```
   This generates types based on your Cloudflare Workers environment.

## API Endpoints

### Voice API

| Endpoint    | Method | Description                                 |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `/incoming` | GET    | Handles incoming calls and routing          |
| `/record`   | GET    | Provides recording instructions and prompts |
| `/hangup`   | GET    | Terminates calls after recording            |
| `/store`    | POST   | Processes and stores completed recordings   |
| `/health`   | GET    | Health check endpoint                       |

### Call Flow

The current implementation provides the following call flow:

1. **Incoming Call** ‚Üí `/incoming`

   - Checks if caller number is in authorized numbers list
   - **Authorized numbers**: Redirected to `/menu` (currently returns 404 - menu system planned)
   - **Unauthorized numbers**: Redirected to `/record` for voicemail recording

2. **Recording** ‚Üí `/record`

   - Plays configured prompt (audio file or text-to-speech)
   - Initiates voice recording with specified parameters
   - Automatically proceeds to hangup after recording

3. **Completion** ‚Üí `/hangup`

   - Terminates call after recording completion
   - Returns TwiML hangup instruction

4. **Storage** ‚Üí `/store`
   - Receives recording callback from provider (currently Twilio)
   - Downloads recording metadata and file
   - Stores recording in Cloudflare R2 bucket
   - Updates central index with call metadata

**Note**: The menu system for authorized callers is planned but not yet implemented. Currently, authorized numbers will receive a 404 response when redirected to `/menu`.

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Endpoints

1. Create a new file in `src/endpoint/`
2. Implement the `OpenAPIRoute` class from Chanfana
3. Define the OpenAPI schema with proper Zod validation
4. Register the route in `src/index.ts`

### Adding New Providers

1. Create a new provider class in `src/lib/providers/`
2. Extend the `BaseProvider` abstract class
3. Implement all required methods for call handling
4. Add the provider to the factory function in `src/lib/providers/index.ts`
5. Update the `ProviderConfig` discriminated union in `src/types.ts`

### Error Handling

All endpoints implement comprehensive error handling:

- Input validation using Zod schemas
- Provider-specific error handling
- Graceful degradation for service failures
- Detailed error logging

### Testing

The project includes comprehensive testing with Vitest:

```bash
# Run all tests
yarn test

# Run tests with coverage
yarn run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
yarn run test:watch

# Run development server
yarn run dev

# Generate TypeScript types from Wrangler
yarn run cf-typegen

# Deploy to production
yarn run deploy
```
